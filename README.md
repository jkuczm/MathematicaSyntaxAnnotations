on Mathematica Stack Exchange.



## Installation


### Automatic installation

To install SyntaxAnnotations package evaluate:
```Mathematica
Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkuczm/MathematicaSyntaxAnnotations/master/BootstrapInstall.m"]
```

Note that this will also install
[ProjectInstaller](https://github.com/lshifr/ProjectInstaller)
package, if you don't have it already installed.

To load SyntaxAnnotations package evaluate: ``Needs["SyntaxAnnotations`"]``.


### Manual installation

1. Download latest released
   [SyntaxAnnotations.zip](https://github.com/jkuczm/MathematicaSyntaxAnnotations/releases/download/v0.1.3/SyntaxAnnotations.zip)
   file.

2. Extract downloaded `SyntaxAnnotations.zip` to any directory which is on
   Mathematica `$Path`, e.g. to one obtained by evaluating
   `FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory,"Applications"}]`.

3. To load the package evaluate: ``Needs["SyntaxAnnotations`"]``


### No installation

To use package directly from the Web, without installation, evaluate:
```Mathematica
Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkuczm/MathematicaSyntaxAnnotations/master/SyntaxAnnotations/SyntaxAnnotations.m"]
```



## Compatibility

This package contains extensive
[automatic test suite](https://github.com/jkuczm/MathematicaSyntaxAnnotations/tree/master/SyntaxAnnotations/Tests).
Package is being tested with Mathematica versions 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0 on Linux.
Since it doesn't contain any OS specific code it should work with above
versions on all operating systems.

There's also no obvious reason for package not to work on earlier (6.0+)
versions of Mathematica.
